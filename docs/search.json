    "text": "Introduction to Single-Cell RNA-seq\n\nRNA-seq allows profiling the transcripts in a sample in an efficient and cost-effective way.\nPart of its success is due to the fact that RNA-seq allows for an unbiased sampling of all transcripts in a sample, rather than being limited to a pre-determined set of transcripts (as in microarrays or RT-qPCR).\nTypically, RNA-seq has been used in samples composed of a mixture of cells, referred to as bulk RNA-seq, and has many applications.\nFor example, it can be used to characterise expression signatures between tissues in healthy/diseased, wild-type/mutant or control/treated samples.\nHowever, with bulk RNA-seq we can only estimate the average expression level for each gene across a population of cells, without regard for the heterogeneity in gene expression across individual cells of that sample."
