# Processing scRNAseq reads generated from Nextflow pipeline

## Recap from Day 1

- Yesterday we covered:
  - How to use Unix.
  - How to get onto HAWK.
  - How to fetch the Github repository and download the resources.
  - How to execute the scrnaseq nextflow pipeline on Hawk.
  
## Outputs from the nextflow pipeline

- The output from the nextflow execution run is stored under `results/cellranger_count_1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3`
- Login to your Hawk account and access the folder:

```
cd /scratch/c.123456/scrnaseq-course/scrnaseq/results

cd cellranger_count_1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3
```

## Downloading data for analysis in Seurat (for analysis on RStudio on local system)

- You can skip this step if you are working on RStudio Server.
- Once the counts are generated using nextflow pipeline, download the data onto your personal computer.
- For this, you will need to use Filezilla to copy the files from remote onto your local machine.
- Follow the steps below:

1. Type in the Host: hawklogin.cf.ac.uk
2. Username: <hawk username>
3. Password: <hawk password>
4. Port: 22

- Click on `Quickconnect`
- Navigate to the folder `scrnaseq-course/scrnaseq/results`
- Create a folder on your local machine, called `scrnaseq-nextflow`.
- Create 4 folders within `scrnaseq-nextflow` folder:
  - bin
  - input
  - output
  - resources
- Now, Drag and Drop the files from the `results` folder in the remote server to your `input` folder within `scrnaseq-nextflow` folder on your local machine.
- Once the files are copied, these should be visible on your local machine under `input` folder.

## Processing scrnaseq data (1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3) in Seurat 

- Once the counts have been downloaded into the `input` folder on your local machine, Start **RStudio** on Mac/Windows.

- Click on `New File` --> `R Markdown...`

- This is will open an `Untiltled` file on the top-left hand side.

- Delete lines from 7 until 29 except first 5-6 lines.

#### Load libraries

- Copy the line in your markdown document:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
# load libraries
library(Seurat)
```

- Press the green arrow key on line 7 which says **Run Current Chunk** to load the Seurat library.

#### Setup the Seurat object

- We start by reading in the data. The `Read10X()` function reads in the output of the cellranger pipeline from 10X, returning a unique molecular identified (UMI) count matrix.
- The values in this matrix represent the number of molecules for each feature (i.e. gene; row) that are detected in each cell (column).

```r
# Load the 1k mouse kidney dataset
dat2 <- Read10X(data.dir = "input/filtered_feature_bc_matrix/")
```

- We next use the count matrix to create a Seurat object. 

```r
# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).
dat2Obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = dat2, project = "1KmouseKidney", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)

dat2Obj
```

#### QC and filtering cells for further analysis

- Seurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria.
- These includes:
  - The number of unique genes detected in each cell.
    - Low-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes
    - Cell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count
  - The percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome.
    - Low-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination
    - We calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the `PercentageFeatureSet()` function
    - We use the set of all genes starting with `MT-` or `mt-` as a set of mitochondrial genes

```r
# The [[ operator can add columns to object metadata.
dat2Obj[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(dat2Obj, pattern = "^mt-")
```

- To visualize QC metrics, we use `VlnPlot()` function.

```r
# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(dat2Obj, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), ncol = 3)
```
