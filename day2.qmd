# Day 2 - Processing scRNAseq reads generated from Nextflow pipeline

## Recap from Day 1

- Yesterday we covered:
  - How to use Unix.
  - How to get onto HAWK.
  - How to fetch the Github repository and download the resources.
  - How to execute the scrnaseq nextflow pipeline on Hawk.
  
## Outputs from the nextflow pipeline

- The output from the nextflow execution run is stored under `results/cellranger_count_1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3`
- Login to your Hawk account and access the folder:

```{bash}
cd /scratch/c.123456/scrnaseq-course/scrnaseq/results

cd cellranger_count_1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3
```

## Downloading data for analysis in Seurat (for analysis on RStudio on local system)

- You can skip this step if you are working on RStudio Server.
- Once the counts are generated using nextflow pipeline, download the data onto your personal computer.
- For this, you will need to use Filezilla to copy the files from remote onto your local machine.
- Follow the steps below:

1. Type in the Host: hawklogin.cf.ac.uk
2. Username: <hawk username>
3. Password: <hawk password>
4. Port: 22

- Click on `Quickconnect`
- Navigate to the folder `scrnaseq-course/scrnaseq/results`
- Create a folder on your local machine, called `scrnaseq-nextflow`.
- Create 4 folders within `scrnaseq-nextflow` folder:
  - bin
  - input
  - output
  - resources
- Now, Drag and Drop the files from the `results` folder in the remote server to your `input` folder within `scrnaseq-nextflow` folder on your local machine.
- Once the files are copied, these should be visible on your local machine under `input` folder.

## Processing scrnaseq data (1k_mouse_kidney_CNIK_3pv3) in Seurat 

- Once the counts have been downloaded into the `input` folder on your local machine, Start **RStudio** on Mac/Windows.
